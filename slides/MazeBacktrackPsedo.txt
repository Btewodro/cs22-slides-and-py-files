solve( position):
    if position is out of maze:
       return solved
    for each new position in the four directions:
        if (can we move there and we have not been there before):
            if solve( new position) is solved:
                return solved
    return not solved


Generalized problem:

solve(state):
    if state is solution:
        return true
    for each valid transition to new state:
        if solve(new state):
            return true
    return false
